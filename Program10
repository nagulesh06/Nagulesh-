10. Find the GCD of Two Numbers Using the Euclidean Algorithm

Algorithm:
	1.	Start
	2.	Input: Read two integers, a and b, from the user.
	3.	Process:
	•	While b is not equal to 0:
	•	Compute the remainder r of a divided by b.
	•	Set a to b and b to r.
	4.	Output: The value of a is the GCD of the two numbers.
	5.	End

Pseudocode:

BEGIN
    INPUT a, b  // Read two integers from the user

    WHILE b ≠ 0 DO
        r ← a MOD b  // Compute remainder of a divided by b
        a ← b        // Set a to b
        b ← r        // Set b to remainder
    END WHILE

    PRINT "GCD is: ", a  // Output the GCD
END

Flowchart Description:
	1.	Start
	2.	Input: Prompt the user to enter two integers, a and b.
	3.	Process:
	•	Decision: Is b equal to 0?
	•	Yes: Proceed to step 4.
	•	No:
	•	Compute r = a MOD b.
	•	Set a = b and b = r.
	•	Repeat from step 3.
	4.	Output: Display the value of a as the GCD.
	5.	End
