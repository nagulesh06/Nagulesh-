9. Count Vowels in a String

Algorithm:
	1.	Start
	2.	Input: Read the string s from the user.
	3.	Initialize: Set vowel_count = 0.
	4.	Process: Loop through each character ch in the string s:
	•	If ch is a vowel (i.e., ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’ or their uppercase counterparts), increment vowel_count by 1.
	5.	Output: Display the value of vowel_count.
	6.	End

Pseudocode:

BEGIN
    INPUT s  // Read the string from the user
    vowel_count ← 0  // Initialize vowel count

    FOR each character ch IN s DO
        IF ch IS 'a' OR ch IS 'e' OR ch IS 'i' OR ch IS 'o' OR ch IS 'u' OR
           ch IS 'A' OR ch IS 'E' OR ch IS 'I' OR ch IS 'O' OR ch IS 'U' THEN
            vowel_count ← vowel_count + 1
        END IF
    END FOR

    PRINT "Number of vowels: ", vowel_count
END

Flowchart:
	1.	Start
	2.	Input: Prompt the user to enter a string s.
	3.	Initialize: Set vowel_count = 0.
	4.	Process: Loop through each character ch in the string s:
	•	Decision: Is ch a vowel?
	•	Yes: Increment vowel_count by 1.
	•	No: Continue to the next character.
	5.	Output: Display the value of vowel_count.
	6.	End
