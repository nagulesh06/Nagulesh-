7. Number Guessing Game

Algorithm:
	1.	Start
	2.	Generate a random number target between 1 and 100
	3.	Repeat:
	•	Prompt the user to input a guess
	•	If guess == target, print “Correct! You guessed it!” and exit
	•	If guess < target, print “Too low! Try again.”
	•	If guess > target, print “Too high! Try again.”
	4.	End

Pseudocode:

BEGIN
    target ← RANDOM(1, 100)
    
    REPEAT
        PRINT "Enter your guess:"
        INPUT guess
        
        IF guess = target THEN
            PRINT "Correct! You guessed it!"
            EXIT
        ELSE IF guess < target THEN
            PRINT "Too low! Try again."
        ELSE
            PRINT "Too high! Try again."
        END IF
    UNTIL guess = target

END

Flowchart Description:
	1.	Start
	2.	Generate a random number (target) between 1 and 100
	3.	Loop:
	•	Input the user’s guess
	•	If the guess is correct, print success message and exit
	•	If the guess is too low, print “Too low! Try again.”
	•	If the guess is too high, print “Too high! Try again.”
	4.	End
